# Biography

I started PhD in Machine Intelligence under Tencent-CUHK PhD Fellowship in fall 2018,
where I am co-supervised by Tom Z.Q. Luo at Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen
and Tong Zhang at Tencent AI Lab.
I also collaborate closely with Dr. Jing Shao at SenseTime Research.
I completed my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Techonology,
where I did my thesis with Prof. Kun He and Dr. Wei Chen in learning multi-channel influence in networks.
I also had great forture to be invited to Cornell University by Prof. John Hopcroft for exchange study and research on community detection problem in social network.
I previously interned at Microsoft Research Asia hosted by Wei Chen and also at SenseTime Research hosted by Jing Shao.
I am a member of Shaw College, CUHK.
