# Biography
I started PhD in Machine Intelligence under Tencent-CUHK PhD Fellowship in fall 2018,
where I am co-supervised by
[**Tong Zhang**](http://tongzhang-ml.org) at Tencent AI Lab and
[**Tom Z.Q. Luo**](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/node/659) at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
I also collaborate closely with [Jing Shao](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~jshao/) at SenseTime Research.
I had great forture to be invited to Cornell University by [**John E. Hopcroft**](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/) for exchange study and research on community detection problem in social network in my undergrad time.
I completed my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
where I did my thesis with [Kun He](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/hekun/en/) and [John E. Hopcroft](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/) in learning multi-channel influence in networks.
I previously interned at Microsoft Research Asia hosted by [Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) and also at SenseTime Research hosted by [Jing Shao](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~jshao/).
I am a member of Shaw College, CUHK.
